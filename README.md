# Project Introduction:

Welcome to the NYC Socioeconomic Housing Project. This is a data-driven exploration of the socioeconomic landscape and its impact on housing values and safety in New York City. This project uses data science, data analysis and geospatial tools to discover insights on the relationships between essential services such as transportation, healthcare facilities, libraries, and more on the value of houses, along with safety indicators.

## Objective:
Using data analysis, data visualization, and data science (data predictive modelling), this project aims to reveal how accessibility to critical services can influence the socioeconomic status of neighborhoods and how it affects housing prices and safety within the city.

## Tools Used:
Python: Primarily utilized for data processing, analysis, and modeling
Jupyter Notebooks: Employed for exploratory data analysis and developing machine learning models
Pandas and NumPy: Used for data manipulation and numerical computations
Scikit-learn: Applied for machine learning algorithms and predictive modeling
Geospatial Tools and Libraries (GeoPandas, Folium, ArcGIS): Leveraged for mapping and analyzing geospatial data
Visualization Libraries (Matplotlib, Seaborn): Utilized to create insightful visual representations of data findings

Tenatative: Implement the data visualizations and models into ann interactive website
